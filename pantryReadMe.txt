Note for running Pantry.cpp:

Requires Provision.cpp and Provision.h to function
Save all three on the same directory and compile together with 
g++/gcc command: g++ pantry.cpp Provision.cpp -o pantry 

Creates two files: One CSV type file for data permanence and 
one .txt file for human use as a shopping list.

I'll be adding features to the program in the comming months and
will be updating this readme as I go.
